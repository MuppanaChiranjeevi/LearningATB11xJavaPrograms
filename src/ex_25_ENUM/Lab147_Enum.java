    /**
     * An Enum (short for Enumeration) is a special Java data type used to define collections of constants.
     * According to the Java naming conventions, all constants should be written in capital letters.
     * So, we have enum constants in capital letters.
     * Enums provide a type-safe way to work with fixed sets of related constants.
     * Java Enums are similar to classes but they only have a fixed set of constants (a variable that does not change).
     * Java Enum constants are implicitly public, static, and final, so you cannot change them after creation.
     * Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
     * Enums are used to create our own data type like classes.
     * Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend another class because they implicitly extend java.lang.Enum class
     * Enum can be traversed.
     * The enum can be defined within or outside the class because it is similar to a class.
     * The semicolon (;) at the end of the enum constants are optional.
     * Note: Constructor of enum type is private. Even if you donâ€™t explicitly write private,
     *       the Java compiler automatically makes the constructor private.
     * Each constant is a singleton instance of the enum.
     * Enum types in Java cannot be instantiated using the new keyword because they are implicitly final and their constructors are private.
     * The ordinal() method returns the position (index) of the enum constant.
     * It starts from 0 for the first constant.
