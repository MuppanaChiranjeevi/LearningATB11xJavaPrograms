     * A do-while loop in Java is a control flow statement that is used to execute a block of code
     * at least once and then repeatedly executes it as long as a specified condition is true.
     *
     * Itâ€™s similar to a while loop, but with one key difference:
     * do-while loop checks the condition at the end of loop body, ensuring code block gets executed at least once, even if the condition is false.
     *
     * A do-while loop is an exit-controlled loop in Java,
     * ->meaning it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.
     * Syntax:
     * do{
     * //code to be executed / loop body
     * //update statement
     * }while (condition);
